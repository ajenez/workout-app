# Workout Finder

A mobile-first web app that helps a gym beginner figure out what to do: pick a
muscle group from a list and get beginner-friendly exercises that train it — each
with **sets/reps/rest guidance**, **form cues**, **common mistakes to avoid**, and
an **embedded YouTube demo** of proper form that plays right in the page.

Built for the author's girlfriend, who's a lifelong athlete (soccer — strong legs,
strong core) but new to the gym, so she can feel confident choosing exercises.

## Status: v3, working

The whole app is a **single self-contained file: [`index.html`](index.html)**.
No build step, no dependencies, no framework, no backend. Open it in any browser,
or host it anywhere static.

Everything below has been built and verified working (muscle picker, equipment
filter, exercise cards with sets/reps/cues/mistakes, inline video players, saving
to favorites, routines, and tips).

### What changed since v2
- **Refactored from "tap a body diagram" into a 4-tab app.** The clickable SVG
  body figure was **removed entirely** — the muscle picker is now a region-grouped
  list of chips (Upper body / Core / Lower body), which is more reliable on a phone.
- **Richer exercise cards.** Each exercise now shows **sets · reps · rest**, a
  short list of **form cues**, **common mistakes**, the **gear** it needs, and the
  **secondary muscles** it works — not just a name + description.
- **Equipment filter.** Toggle which equipment is available (Bodyweight, Dumbbells,
  Cables, Machines, Barbell) and the exercise list filters to match.
- **Save / favorites.** A ♡ Save button on every exercise persists to
  `localStorage` and shows up under the **Saved** tab. Degrades gracefully in
  private/incognito mode (shows a heads-up banner instead of silently failing).
- **Routines tab.** Three hand-curated starter programs (Full body 3×/week, Glute
  focus, Upper/lower split). They reference exercises by key, so they stay in sync
  with the exercise data automatically.
- **Tips tab.** Short gym-confidence tips (etiquette, resting, starting light).

## How to run / share

It's a static file, so any of these work:

- **Locally:** double-click `index.html`, or run a static server in the folder:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 4173
  # then open http://localhost:4173
  ```
- **GitHub Pages (how the author plans to share it):** push the folder to a repo,
  go to Settings → Pages, set source to the `main` branch root. The app will be
  served at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- Or drop it on Netlify / any static host.

> `.claude/launch.json` is configured to serve the folder for the Claude Code
> preview tool. Harmless to keep or delete.

> **Custom domain note:** an earlier attempt to point `www.hannahsworkout.com` at
> GitHub Pages failed only because **the domain is not registered yet** (it has no
> DNS records). Buy the domain first, then add a `CNAME` DNS record
> (`www` → `<user>.github.io`) and a `CNAME` file in the repo containing the domain.

## What it does (features)

The app is four tabs, switched from a fixed bottom nav bar:

1. **Exercises** — the main screen.
   - **Equipment filter** at the top: Bodyweight, Dumbbells, Cables, Machines,
     Barbell. All on by default (built for a fully-equipped city gym). Toggling a
     chip re-filters the currently-shown muscle group instantly.
   - **Muscle picker** grouped by region — **Upper body** (chest, back, shoulders,
     biceps, triceps, traps, forearms), **Core** (abs, lower back), **Lower body**
     (glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves).
   - Tapping a group renders its **exercise cards** below (filtered by equipment).
   - **Focus sub-filter:** some groups have a second chip row to target a region of
     the muscle — **Glutes** (Overall / Upper & side, i.e. gluteus medius),
     **Shoulders** (Front / Side / Rear), **Back** (Lats / Mid-back), **Abs**
     (Upper / Lower / Obliques). "All" is the default; the focus chips stack with
     the equipment filter.
2. **Routines** — three expandable starter programs. Each lists its exercises in
   order with sets × reps and a quick ▶ video button.
3. **Saved** — favorited exercises (full cards), persisted in `localStorage`.
4. **Tips** — short gym-confidence tips.

### Exercise card contents
Each exercise shows: name, a **Beginner / Intermediate** badge, a one-line
description, a **sets · reps · rest** row, **form cues**, **common mistakes**, a
**gear** pill, a **secondary muscles** pill, a **▶ Watch demo** button (inline
YouTube player) and a **♡ Save** button.

### Covered muscle groups (13) / exercises (66)
chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, traps, forearms (upper); abs, lower back
(core); glutes, quads, hamstrings, calves (lower). Weighted toward machines /
dumbbells / cables / bodyweight that are easy to learn. (Lower-body selection
leans a little more advanced — the user is a strong-legged ex-athlete.) The glutes
group includes a full set of gluteus-medius (upper/side glute) exercises behind
the **Upper & side** focus.

## Key design decisions (please preserve unless asked otherwise)

1. **Single self-contained HTML file**, no build tooling — chosen for trivial
   sharing and GitHub Pages compatibility. Don't introduce a framework/build step
   unless the user wants ongoing feature growth.
2. **Muscle picker is a list of chips, not a body diagram.** The old SVG figure
   was removed in v3; chips grouped by region are the navigation. Don't re-add an
   SVG body unless asked.
3. **YouTube "Watch" buttons embed a curated, hard-coded video per exercise.**
   Each exercise in `DATA` has a `yt` field holding an 11-character YouTube video
   ID, rendered as a `youtube-nocookie.com/embed/<id>` iframe.
   - **Why curated and not the live YouTube API:** to keep the single-file,
     zero-setup, zero-API-key design (a "fetch the highest-view video live"
     approach would need a Google API key exposed in the public file).
   - **Dead-link safety:** every player keeps a fallback link that opens a YouTube
     **search**, so if a hard-coded video is ever removed the user can still find a
     replacement.
4. **Saving degrades gracefully.** `localStorage` is wrapped in try/catch; if it's
   unavailable (private mode), the Saved tab shows a banner rather than failing
   silently. Don't assume `localStorage` always works.
5. **Routines reference exercises by key, never by duplicating content.** A routine
   item is a `"group:key"` string looked up in the flat `ALL` map. Fix an exercise
   once and it's fixed everywhere it appears.
6. **Major muscle groups only**, but groups can have an optional **focus
   sub-filter** for the regions a beginner actually cares about (e.g. upper/side
   glutes). Configured in `FOCUS` / `FOCUS_MAP`, not by splitting the group. Don't
   add individual-head groups to the muscle picker — use a focus instead.
7. **Dark theme**, `--accent` is the red/coral brand color. Focus chips use
   `--good` (teal) to distinguish them from the red muscle chips.

## Code map (all inside `index.html`)

- **`<style>`** — all CSS. Theme variables are at the top under `:root`.
  Layout is mobile-first with a fixed bottom `.tabbar`. Key classes: `.view`
  (one per tab, `.on` = visible), `.card` (an exercise card), `.srr` (the
  sets/reps/rest row), `.cues` / `.mistakes` (the bullet lists), `.pill`
  (gear / secondary-muscle chips), `.player` (`.player.open` reveals the inline
  iframe), `.routine` / `.rrow` (routines), `.tip`, `.banner`.
- **`<script>`**:
  - **`DATA`** — the single source of truth for content. An object keyed by group
    id; each entry has a `title` and an `ex` array. Each exercise is:
    ```js
    { key, name, level, yt, equip:[...], gear, sets, reps, rest,
      desc, cues:[...], mistakes:[...], secondary:[...] }
    ```
    - `key` is unique **within** its group; routines address exercises as
      `"group:key"`.
    - `equip` drives the equipment filter (subset of `EQUIP`).
    - `yt` is a real, oEmbed-verified YouTube ID. **Edit this object to
      add/remove/change exercises or swap a video.**
  - **`REGIONS`** — controls how muscle groups are grouped/ordered in the picker.
  - **`EQUIP`** — the five equipment filter options.
  - **`FOCUS` / `FOCUS_MAP`** — the optional per-group focus sub-filter. `FOCUS[group]`
    is the ordered `[key, label]` chips to show (e.g. glutes →
    `[["overall","Overall"],["medius","Upper & side"]]`); `FOCUS_MAP[group][exKey]`
    assigns each exercise to one focus. Focus is **not** stored on the `DATA` object —
    it's attached when `ALL` is built. A group absent from `FOCUS` simply shows no
    focus row. To add a focus to a group, add it to both `FOCUS` and `FOCUS_MAP`.
  - **`ROUTINES`** — array of starter programs; each has `days[]`, each day a list
    of `"group:key"` item strings.
  - **`TIPS`** — array of gym-confidence tip strings.
  - **`ALL`** — a flat map built at load time: `ALL["group:key"]` → the exercise
    object (plus `group` / `groupTitle`). Used by routines, saving, and rendering.
  - **`cardHTML(id)` / `rowHTML(id)`** — render a full exercise card / a compact
    routine row from a `"group:key"` id.
  - **`showGroup(group, focus)`** — renders the filtered exercise list for a muscle
    group, plus the focus chip row if the group has one. `focus` is optional
    (defaults to the current/"all" focus); the focus chips call it with an explicit
    focus key.
  - **`toggleEquip(btn)`** — toggles an equipment filter and re-renders.
  - **`toggleVid(btn)`** — expands/collapses the inline player (one open at a
    time); works for both full cards and routine rows.
  - **`toggleSave(btn)` / `renderSaved()` / `persistSaved()`** — favorites +
    `localStorage` (with the private-mode fallback).
  - **`renderRoutines()` / `toggleRoutine(i)`**, **`renderTips()`** — routines/tips.
  - **`showTab(t)`** — switches the active tab.

### To add a new exercise
Find the group in `DATA` and add an object to its `ex` array. Give it a `key`
unique within that group and fill in every field:
```js
{ key:"inclinepushup", name:"Incline Push-up", level:"Beginner", yt:"VIDEO_ID",
  equip:["Bodyweight"], gear:"A bench", sets:3, reps:"10–12", rest:"60s",
  desc:"Hands on a bench, easier than the floor.",
  cues:["...","...","..."], mistakes:["...","..."], secondary:["Chest","Triceps"] }
```
Rendering, the embed, the equipment filter, and saving are all automatic.

### To find / swap a video ID
1. Find a good "proper form" tutorial on YouTube; the ID is the `v=` part of
   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`.
2. **Verify it's embeddable** before trusting it — a `200` with JSON means it
   exists and is embeddable:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
   ```
3. Paste the ID into the exercise's `yt` field.

> ⚠️ Never invent video IDs. Every `yt` value must be a real ID you verified with
> the oEmbed check above — a wrong ID silently embeds the wrong video or a dead
> player. (All current IDs were validated this way.)

### To add a new muscle group
1. Add an entry to `DATA` with a new group id (with all fields on each exercise).
2. Add the group id to the right region in `REGIONS`.

### To add a routine
Add an object to `ROUTINES` with `name`, `meta`, `note`, and `days` (each day a
list of `"group:key"` item strings that must exist in `DATA`).

## Ideas / backlog (not built)
- "Workout of the day" / randomized session from the data.
- Mark exercises as done / simple session logging.
- Personalize (her name in the title).
- (Done in v3: equipment filter, sets/reps/cues/mistakes, save/favorites,
  routines, tips. Done in v2: embedded curated demo videos.)
